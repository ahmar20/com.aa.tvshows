# Street Media
Free and Open Source Android App

This is a hobby-app made for learning purposes. There is no affiliation to any person or business in any case.
The app is freely available to download at [XDA Labs](https://www.xda-developers.com/xda-labs/). The XDA Forum for the app is [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-street-media-tv-streaming-app-t3937429/).

# App Details
The app does not ask for any permissions because no special permission is needed. The only permissions that are required are for WiFi/Network State and Internet. The app currently stores data within the app cache/directory which is available to every app as permanent storage. 

This app was made possible with countless searches on Google, StackOverflow and some Open Source libraries.
The app is being developed on VS Community 2019 with Xamarin Android.

The libraries included in the app are:
1. [Xamarin AndroidX](https://github.com/xamarin/AndroidX)
2. [Html Agility Pack](https://github.com/zzzprojects/html-agility-pack)
3. [Javascript Interpreter for .NET](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint)
4. [Newtonsoft Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)
5. [Square Picasso](https://github.com/mattleibow/square-bindings)
6. [.NET Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)

# Troubleshooting Guide
If for some reason you experience problems and, you cannot stream anything or, the app does not show any data then it is recommended to use a VPN service for the app. I personally use [hide.me](https://hide.me) (use my [referral](https://ref.hide.io/VbpZ8L) please and help me) and they provide 2GB of monthly free data to those who sign-up for a free account.

If you experience any other issues, for example: crashes etc or weird behavior from the app, then you can head to Issues above and create an issue with your problem.
