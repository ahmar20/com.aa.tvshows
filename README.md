# Street Media
Free and Open Source Android App

This is a hobby-app made for learning purposes. There is no affiliation to any person or business in any case.
~~The app is freely available to download at [XDA Labs](https://www.xda-developers.com/xda-labs/)~~. Due to non-availibility of XDA Labs, the app shall be offered through other platforms and the links will be available here in time. The XDA Forum for the app is [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-street-media-tv-streaming-app-t3937429/) and you can reach me there for discussions / improvements / suggestions etc.

# App Details
The app does not ask for any permissions because no special permission is needed. The only permissions that are required are for WiFi/Network State and Internet. The app currently stores data within the app cache/directory which is available to every app as permanent storage.

This app was made possible with countless searches on Google, StackOverflow and some Open Source libraries.
The app is being developed on VS Community 2022 with ~~Xamarin~~ .NET for Android.

The libraries included in the app are:
1. [AndroidX for .NET for Android](https://github.com/xamarin/AndroidX)
2. [Html Agility Pack](https://github.com/zzzprojects/html-agility-pack)
3. [Javascript Interpreter for .NET](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint)
4. [Newtonsoft Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)
5. [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
6. [.NET Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)
7. [ExoPlayer for Xamarin](https://github.com/Baseflow/ExoPlayerXamarin)

# Troubleshooting Guide
If, for some reason, you experience problems and you cannot stream anything, or the app does not show any data, then it is recommended to use a VPN service for the app. I personally use [hide.me](https://hide.me) (use my [referral](https://ref.hide.io/VbpZ8L)) and they provide 10GB of monthly free data to those who sign-up for a free account.

If you experience any other issues, for example: crashes etc. or weird behavior from the app, then you can head to Issues above and create an issue with as much detail as possible.

# Disclaimer/Legal Issues
No content in the app is being hosted by me or any entity, person or business, related to me. The content is available on Internet and can be freely accessed.

If you have any legal issues with the content then please take it to the actual servers/websites hosting the content on their web servers.
